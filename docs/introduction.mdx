# Introduction


The main Objective of this guide is to provide an structured way to understand the risk associated to use Node.js and the js ecosystem and how to mitigate possible vulnerabilities.

This guide is maintained and developed by [the Security Working Group](#about-security-working-group).


## Target Audience

This guide intents to help everyone who wants to build more secure applications in Node.js but is not intended to be a course on how to write Nodejs applications (see for instance [Introduction to Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn)).

## About Security Working Group

The Security Working Group manages all aspects and processes linked to Node.js security.

Responsibilities include:

- Define and maintain security policies and procedures for:
    - the core Node.js project
    - other projects maintained by the Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
- Work with the Node Security Platform to bring community vulnerability data into the foundation as a shared asset.
- Ensure the vulnerability data is updated in an efficient and timely manner. For example, ensuring there are well-documented processes for reporting vulnerabilities in community modules.
- Review and recommend processes for handling of security reports (but not the actual administration of security reports, which are reviewed by a group of people directly delegated to by the TSC).
- Define and maintain policies and procedures for the coordination of security concerns within the external Node.js open source ecosystem.
- Offer help to npm package maintainers to fix high-impact security bugs.
- Maintain and make available data on disclosed security vulnerabilities in:
    - the core Node.js project
    - other projects maintained by the Node.js Foundation technical group
    - the external Node.js open source ecosystem
- Promote the improvement of security practices within the Node.js ecosystem.
- Recommend security improvements for the core Node.js project.
- Facilitate and promote the expansion of a healthy security service and product provider ecosystem.
