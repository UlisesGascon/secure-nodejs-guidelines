## Releases

**Node.js released are divided in categories:**

- Current: are odd-numbered releases (9, 11, etc.) and become unsupported after 6 months
- Active LTS (long-term support): are even-numbered releases (10, 12, etc.) the first 6 months
- Maintenance LTS (long-term support): are even-numbered releases (10, 12, etc.), after 6 months active LTS becomes Maintenance LTS  which typically guarantees that critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months

:::tip

Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases. More details in [Node.js Releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases)

## Docker releases

The official docker images are maintained by [The Node.js Docker Team](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node)

**There are three variants:**

- `node:<version>`: defacto image based on debian, like `node:17.9.0`
- `node:<version>-alpine`: image based on [Alpine Linux project](https://alpinelinux.org/), like `node:17.9.0-alpine3.15`
- `node:<version>-slim`: Minimal image based on debian, like `node:17.9.0-slim`


:::tip

Production applications should try to use the base images that bundle the necesary resources for your application, that will reduce the surface attack. More details in [The Node.js Dockerhub Repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/node)
