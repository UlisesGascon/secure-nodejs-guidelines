# Best Practices

## Node.js Versions 

- Use Node.js LTS (long-term support) versions in production as you have an extended support
- If you are using Docker always use the official images and prioritize the use of Alpine (`node:<version>-alpine`) or Slim (`node:<version>-slim`) versions rather than defacto (`node:<version>`) in order to reduce [the surface attack for your Node.js application](https://snyk.io/blog/10-docker-image-security-best-practices/)
